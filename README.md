## Deployment

Here is a testing video of the fullstack project.

(video will be here soon)


## Conclusion

The idea behind Speaker was to create a simulated TED talk project, primarily focusing on building the backend with Java and establishing the necessary connections to make it a fullstack application where anybody can suscribe to give a talk and then an admin part where the people who have access can edit and track the susbcribers.
